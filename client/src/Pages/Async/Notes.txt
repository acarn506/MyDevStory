-- A timeline showcaseing my projects and learning througth the last several years.

-- Structure: bramch of some sort

-- The main branch will be running a for loop inside of a async function

-- several sub branches will be running async in betwwen the main branch

-- This way the call stack will be able to interleave sections of the main branch with the sub branches

-- Possibly 
    - main branch is the things i have learned
    - sub branch project where i used the things i've learned
